    <div class="question">What is Puffer?</div>
    <p>Puffer is a Stanford University research study
    about using machine learning to improve video-streaming
    algorithms: the kind of algorithms used by services such as
    YouTube, Netflix, and Twitch. We are trying to figure out how to
    teach a computer to design new algorithms that reduce glitches
    and stalls in streaming video (especially over wireless networks
    and those with limited capacity, such as in rural areas),
    improve picture quality, and predict how the capacity of an
    Internet connection will change over time.</p>

    <div class="question">Sounds interesting. What can the public do to help?</div>
    <p>Watch TV on this website. The idea of this study
    is streaming TV channels to study participants over the Internet, and the Puffer website will
    automatically experiment with different algorithms that control the timing and
    quality of video sent to them, and will monitor how well the resulting
    computer-designed algorithms work. The more diverse the Internet
    connections that the study participants use, the better the system will be
    able to learn, and the more robust the resulting computer-generated algorithms.</p>

    <div class="question">So you're doing a research project to improve video streaming technology,
    and my role is to watch television on your website?</div>
    <p>Yes. Well, technically you don't even have to
    watch. We just need people to stream video over different kinds of
    Internet connections, so that the computer has some live traffic
    to learn from and experiment on.</p>

    <div class="question">How can I join the study and watch TV on your website?</div>
    <p>Visit the <a href="{% url 'signup' %}">Sign up</a> page to join.
    You must be within the United States to use Puffer.</p>

    <div class="question">Do I have to pay?</div>
    <p>No, there is no charge to participate. Puffer is
    an academic project at Stanford University and is entirely
    non-profit.</p>

    <div class="question">What channels can I watch?</div>
    <p>Puffer re-transmits free over-the-air broadcast television signals received by an antenna
    located on the campus of Stanford University. At the moment, we are re-transmitting local
    affiliates or owned stations of CBS (KPIX 5 and KPIX+ 44), NBC (KNTV 11), ABC (KGO 7), Fox (KTVU 2),
    PBS (KQED 9), CW (KRON 4).</p>

    <div class="question">Do you make any changes to the local TV channels?</div>
    <p>No, Puffer retransmits the local stations we can receive without any modification.</p>

    <div class="question">Can you please add HBO/CNN/ESPN?</div>
    <p>No, we can only re-transmit free over-the-air broadcast television signals.</p>

    <div class="question">Why doesn't Puffer work on my iPhone or iPad?</div>
    <p>Puffer uses the Web <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/">Media Source
    Extensions (MSE)</a> to stream video.  This standard is not
    supported by all browsers, and in particular, it is not supported
    by Safari on iOS (and we understand other browser engines are not
    allowed on iOS, which means it is not possible to watch Puffer on
    an iPhone or iPad). Puffer does work in Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge,
    and Opera (including on Android phones and tablets).
    If you are having trouble, please contact the research team by
    visiting <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/puffer-stanford">the
    puffer-stanford Google Group</a>.</p>

    <div class="question">Why doesn't Puffer work on Safari on my desktop Mac?</div>
    <p>Puffer uses the <a href="https://opus-codec.org/">Opus audio</a>
    standard, which Safari supports only for real-time video
    (WebRTC) but not for video streaming (in a WebM container).</p>

    <div class="question">So... what browsers does Puffer work on again?</div>
    <p>Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Microsoft Edge, on
    Mac/Windows/Linux computers and on Android phones and
    tablets.</p>

    <div class="question">Why do I keep seeing connection timeout errors?</div>
    <p>The short answer: If Puffer is not in an active tab being directly viewed, we can't
    guarantee how your browser/device will behave. If you play Puffer in the background and
    see this error upon returning, please just refresh the page.</p>

    <p>The long answer: Puffer requires clients to frequently communicate with the
    server to avoid timeouts. Further, as a live streaming service, Puffer does
    not support pausing. However, many mobile devices implement mechanisms to force video pausing
    regardless of application support. Such pausing happens in response to switching from Puffer
    to other applications, or pausing video via the notification center. When such pausing occurs, server timeouts may occur. Additionally,
    poor network conditions can cause timeouts, as can leaving Puffer open in a
    background tab for browsers which restrict the resource consumption of background tabs.</p>

    <div class="question">Can I help your research project by playing Puffer in a background tab?</div>
    <p>Different browsers have different policies for how they throttle the performance of
    background tabs. Even if your browser is capable of playing video in the background,
    video performance may be reduced. As a result, playing Puffer in the background does not provide
    us with useful data.</p>

    <div class="question">When you say Puffer will learn better
    video-streaming &ldquo;algorithms,&rdquo; which algorithms
    do you mean?</div>
    <p>Puffer is focused on three types of algorithms:
    &ldquo;congestion-control&rdquo; algorithms that decide when to
    send each piece of data, also known as a packet, &ldquo;throughput forecasters,&rdquo;
    which predict how long it will take to send a certain amount of data over
    an Internet connection in the near future, and
    &ldquo;adaptive-bitrate&rdquo; (ABR) algorithms that decide what
    quality of video to send, in order to try to give the user the
    best picture quality that won't lead to a stall or
    rebuffer. All three kinds of algorithms have a long history of work
    by academics and practitioners.</p>

    <div class="question">Why do you need a website with people streaming
    video from you to do this research?</div>
    <p>The core issue here is that developing robust systems takes data
    and experience. Big companies (e.g., YouTube, Netflix, Twitch)
    have lots of users, which means lots of data: they could, at least
    in theory, do experiments where some users get one variant of an
    algorithm for a day, and some get a different variant, and at
    the end of the day there is tons of data to decide which variant
    is better to the bottom-line metrics (generally in terms of
    things like stalls and startup speed, picture quality and the
    variation in quality over time, and cost or wasted bandwidth).</p>

    <p>The challenge for the big companies is that they are generally
    pretty conservative about changing their low-level systems code,
    like congestion-control algorithms and throughput prediction
    algorithms. Letting a machine learn these algorithms online, by
    running a new experiment every hour or so, seems to be a nonstarter for
    these services&mdash;there's too much at risk.</p>

    <p>Academics, on the other hand, historically have had to develop
    network algorithms <a href="http://mit.edu/remy">in simulation</a> or
    in <a href="https://pantheon.stanford.edu">small real-world
    testbeds</a>, sometimes known as &ldquo;offline&rdquo; learning.
    Unfortunately, we have learned through experience that
    algorithms learned in simulation or in small-scale experiments
    sometimes aren't able to replicate their performance in the real
    world, or even in subsequent small-scale experiments. We're
    not sure if it's possible to learn a network algorithm in
    simulation and have it perform robustly on real traffic over the
    real-world Internet. (Nobody has figured out how to do this
    yet, which probably indicates a failure of our simulations,
    but it's not obvious where.) To teach a machine to develop
    robust algorithms automatically, academics need a real
    population of Internet connections we can experiment on.</p>

    <p>Puffer is attempting to answer the question of whether rapid
    &ldquo;online&rdquo; learning&mdash;automatically generating and
    testing algorithms on real users <strong>in situ</strong>&mdash;can successfully produce
    robust systems. Hence this website: a medium-sized video streaming
    website, open to the public, run for academic purposes, that learns
    low-level systems algorithms as a function of who is using it.</p>

    <div class="question">Why are you streaming over-the-air television?</div>
    <p>For the research project to work, we
    need <strong>some</strong> source of video that never ends and
    is sufficiently interesting to attract a few hundred people to
    watch. Broadcast TV is the most interesting thing that we have access to
    and are permitted to retransmit.</p>

    <div class="question">Can you share more technical details about how Puffer works?</div>
    <p>Sure, please check out our <a href="https://puffer.stanford.edu/static/puffer/documents/puffer-paper.pdf">research paper</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/StanfordSNR/puffer">the source code of Puffer</a>.</p>

    <div class="question">Who is responsible for Puffer?</div>
    <p> The Puffer project is led
    by <a href="https://francisyyan.org">Francis
    Yan</a>, a doctoral student in computer science at Stanford
    University, along with Hudson Ayers and Sadjad Fouladi (also
    Stanford) and Chenzhi Zhu (Tsinghua University). The project is
    advised by professors <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~keithw">Keith
    Winstein</a> and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~pal">Philip
    Levis</a>.</p>

    <p>The project has been funded in part by the NSF and DARPA,
    along with support from Google, Huawei, VMware, Dropbox, Facebook,
    and the Stanford Platform Lab.</p>

    <div class="question">Does the research group behind Puffer have any past
    work in this area?</div>
    <p>We have recently published work
    on <a href="https://pantheon.stanford.edu">neural networks and a
    standardized training ground for congestion control</a> and
    on <a href="https://snr.stanford.edu/salsify">better systems for
    real-time Internet video</a> and
    on <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi17/technical-sessions/presentation/fouladi">
    high-speed video encoding using thousands of tiny threads</a>. In earlier days,
    the advisor was responsible for work
    in <a href="https://mit.edu/remy">computer-generated congestion
    control</a> and in <a href="http://alfalfa.mit.edu">forecasting the
    speed of an Internet connection for video</a>
    and <a href="https://mosh.org">integrating application coding and
    congestion control</a>.</p>

    <div class="question">What information do you collect about me?</div>
    <p>As you stream video, the Puffer website will automatically collect information
    from your Web browser, including which video channel was sent to you, the picture quality of
    that video compared with the original version received by our antenna, the timing and duration
    of stalls in the playback, the timing of the delivery or loss of individual Internet Protocol
    datagrams or messages, and the accuracy of predictions the Website makes about the capacity of
    the Internet connection between you and the Website.</p>

    <div class="question">Is there a survey to fill out?</div>
    <p>No, you will not receive a survey or be
    required to answer any questions as part of the study.</p>

    <div class="question">Does this study count as &ldquo;human-subjects research&rdquo;?</div>
    <p>No, the Stanford University Institutional Review Board has determined
    that this project does not meet the definition of human subjects research as defined in federal
    regulations 45 C.F.R. § 46.102 or 21 C.F.R. § 50.3.</p>

    <div class="question">I lost my password. Can I reset it?</div>
    <p>No, Puffer doesn't collect any private information about research subjects,
    not even their email addresses. As a result, it is not possible to reset a lost password.
    If the Puffer website is still accepting new research subjects,
    you can try to create a new account.</p>

    <div class="question">What are the limitations on study participants?</div>
    <p>You must be within the United States to use
    Puffer. The study is limited to 500 participants <em>simultaneously</em>, meaning
    that at most 500 people are allowed to watch Puffer <em>at a time</em>. We expect
    each participant to stream video from the Website for several hours
    each week, and we reserve the right to terminate your participation if
    you do not meet this expectation. You can't copy, distribute,
    rebroadcast, etc., anything you receive from us. Please read the formal
    <a href="{% url 'terms' %}">Terms of Participation</a> before signing up.

    <div class="question">Video streaming already works&mdash;isn't this a solved problem?</div>
    <p>
    It does work for a lot of people!
    <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46403.pdf">
    Google has published</a> that 93% of YouTube sessions <strong>never
    stall to rebuffer</strong>. Whether this means video streaming
    is a solved problem somewhat depends on your perspective. If you
    are on a wireless connection or in a rural area, your results
    are probably worse. And video streaming necessarily involves a
    tradeoff between picture quality and the risk of stall. If you
    care about the picture quality (and not just whether the video
    plays without stalling to rebuffer), your demands probably
    increase with time, especially as video grows to greater
    resolutions and sizes, so even today's wired networks will prove
    inadequate in the future.</p>

    <p>Puffer is unique from previous academic studies on video streaming in that it
    uses <i>online</i> learning to generate adaptive bit rate (ABR) and congestion control
    algorithms. In essence, this means that Puffer regularly learns from past performance to
    construct future algorithms which work better. Ultimately, we hope that this
    approach will produce substantial benefits over prior work, but only time will tell.
    Beyond this fundamental difference, Puffer also approaches the video-streaming problem
    differently in a number of ways. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Puffer's use of structural similarity (SSIM) instead of bitrate
          as the input to quality of experience measurements, ensuring performance measurements
          are more directly linked to user experience. </li>
      <li>Puffer's use of a denser bitrate ladder than most existing systems, allowing for more
          fine-grained control of video quality received by users. </li>
      <li>Use of websockets instead of &ldquo;DASH&rdquo; HTTP request/response pairs, allowing for
          continuous streaming video that is not synchronous with client requests.</li>
      <li>Using congestion control with a tunable pacing rate and a direct access to a throughput
          estimate, instead of having all testing occur on top of TCP.</li>
      <li>Verbose communication between the congestion control layer and the application layer,
          so that application layer decision about video quality can be informed by the bandwidth
          available in the congestion control layer.</li>
      <li>The use of nontraditional signals to train our transmission-time predictor, such as ISP,
          connectivity type, etc.</li>
      <li>Using a direct Transmission Time Predictor (which predicts the time required to send a
          chunk of a certain coded length) instead of simply extrapolating a unitary
          throughput estimate.</li>
      <li>Retraining the Transmission Time Predictor day-by-day as a function of real data.</li>
      <li>Automatically generating variants of the ABR scheme, and evolving them day-by-day as
          a function of real data.</li>
      <li>Using joint control across different users vs. treating each flow separately.</li>
    </ul>
